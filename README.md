# Hand-cage-for-prosthesis

## Introduction
Now humankind has high level of medicine and technologies. It allows us creating artificial limbs, making life easier, for people, who have amputation or innate defects. 
Project target is uding wireless miographic sensor, which sends info about electric implulse by Bluetooth. 

## Definition
In this project I have developed a hand cage for already existing prosthetic hand. For designing I use CAD Solidworks, be more exact Add-Ins ScanTo3D for working with STL file. I convert STL model to "native" Solidworks surfaces. Using surface modelling tools, I divided useless parts and thickened it. After that I connected it to prosthetic socket using "Loft" tool. Digital screen, located at hand cage, manage signal, outgoing from sensors. It has touch feadback option. For Final result represented below.

Result:
